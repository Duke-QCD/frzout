frzout
======
Cooper-Frye hypersurface sampler.

Current status
--------------
The implementation is complete and working well.
I'm working on other things at the moment and have not had time to write documentation;
in the meantime, a variety of visual tests are posted at `qcd.phy.duke.edu/frzout/tests.html <http://qcd.phy.duke.edu/frzout/tests.html>`_.

If you're in the Duke group and want to use this, please ask me!
